# Dactyl ManuForm Mini Keyboard

This is a fork of the [Dactyl-ManuForm-Mini](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard). The Dactyl-Manuform-Mini is a fork of the [Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard), which is a fork of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) with the thumb cluster from [ManuForm](https://github.com/jeffgran/ManuForm).

## Features

Here is the list of features which have been added after the fork from the Dactyl Manuform Mini:

- The use of sidenubs is disabled by default. 
- Top surface is extra thick (3mm), so it can be printed with wooden PLA filament (which is brittle)
- The TRSS hole is bigger to use another type of female insert
- TRSS hole has hole around it so the insert can go in deeper
- The USB hole is bigger, so it can house an adapter. The adapter is to be designed and printed separately. At the moment the only adapter that has been made is an USB-C one. 
- The USB and TRSS holders have been removed

## Getting the case and bottom plate

### Option 1: Generate OpenSCAD and STL models

* Run `lein generate` or `lein auto generate`
* This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files
* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
* When done, use OpenSCAD to export STL files
